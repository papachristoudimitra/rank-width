# rank-width
Exploring rank-width. A heuristic approach and a local search procedure. Implementation in Rstudio.

The data structure that was chosen to represent a tree decomposition was list. Lists have elements, each of which can contain any type of objects. Hence, the elements of a list do not have to be of the same type or size. Each element of the list represents an internal node of the tree, including the root, and contains two set of nodes dening its children. A child can be a subset of the vertices or a single vertex (a leaf).
